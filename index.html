Step	What to Do	Why It Matters
1	Replace plain hero background with a full-screen casino/neon-style hero image or short video loop (make sure it’s optimized for fast load).	First impression — a strong hero grabs attention and sets mood immediately.

2	Add 1–2 big CTA buttons in hero (e.g. “Watch Latest Video”, “Claim Bonus”) with bold contrasting colors.	Guides visitor to take action — conversion depends on clear CTAs.

3	Embed a YouTube playlist or latest videos — maybe a “Latest Wins” / “Slot Plays” section.	Video + social content builds trust and shows you’re active; boosts engagement.

5	Build a “Top Bonuses / Casino Offers” section — neat cards or boxes with bonuses, CTA links, descriptions.	Makes monetization obvious and easy for users; increases affiliate conversions.
6	Clean up layout & spacing, add modern fonts, use consistent colors to match your brand (neon-retro or whatever vibe).	Makes site look professional instead of cheap — aesthetic matters for trust.

7	Make site responsive — check mobile and desktop; ensure hero, buttons, video and text scale well.	Many users browse on phone — if it breaks there, you lose them immediately.

8	Optimize images/videos (compress, correct sizes) — avoid long loading times or slow page speed.	Speed influences bounce rate, user experience, and SEO.
